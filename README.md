# Communication between 2 Arduino using Modbus Protocol
## This Fire Alarm System project uses 2 Arduino to communicate with each other using Modbus communication protocol

#### How to test:
1. Import Modbus.h library into Arduino IDE.
2. Build and Upload master.ino sketch to master Arduino.
3. Build and Upload slave.ino sketch to slave Arduino.
4. Connect the circuit and test.
